This assignment retrieves IVV stock data using yfinance and visualizes it with mplfinance to generate a candlestick chart for the specified date range (January 2025). The development of this code was informed by several online resources addressing customization of mplfinance plots and common plotting errors. In particular, the following references were useful:
•	Customizing mplfinance plot
•	Handling TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars while plotting
•	Error: Data for column open must be all float or int
•	yfinance Documentation
•	mplfinance GitHub Repository
